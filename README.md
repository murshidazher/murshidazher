👋 I'm a Software Engineer based in Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

You may know me from my work as maintainer of [trostcss](https://github.com/murshidazher/trostcss) work. We could meet after work (not possible now due to covid 🦠) or we're just starting our friendship.

🔥 My mission is to build tools to automate my day to day process. I also want to grow things on the internet and let others learn from my mistakes instead of their own.

My main projects:
- 🖌️ [trostcss](https://github.com/murshidazher/trostcss)
- 🧶 [react-play-styled](https://github.com/murshidazher/react-play-styled)
- 🎭 [murshid](https://github.com/murshidazher/murshid)
